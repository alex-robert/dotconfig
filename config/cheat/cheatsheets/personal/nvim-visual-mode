# Neovim Visual Mode Workflow (Native Vim Way)

## Understanding Visual Mode

Visual mode is Vim's native selection mechanism. Unlike multi-cursor which edits multiple places at once, visual mode selects a region, then applies an operation to it.

There are 3 types of visual mode:
- v     (character-wise) - Select individual characters
- V     (line-wise) - Select whole lines
- Ctrl+v (block-wise) - Select rectangular blocks (column editing!)

## Entering Visual Mode

v                        # Start character-wise visual selection
V                        # Start line-wise visual selection
Ctrl+v                   # Start block/column visual selection (POWERFUL!)
gv                       # Re-select last visual selection

## Movement in Visual Mode (Your IJKL Layout)

### Basic Movement
i                        # Extend selection up
k                        # Extend selection down
j                        # Extend selection left
l                        # Extend selection right

### Word Movement
L (Shift+L)              # Extend to next word
J (Shift+J)              # Extend to previous word
w                        # Extend to end of word

### Line Movement
$                        # Extend to end of line
0                        # Extend to start of line
^                        # Extend to first non-blank character

### Fast Movement
K (Shift+K)              # Extend 5 lines down
I (Shift+I)              # Extend 5 lines up
gg                       # Extend to start of file
G                        # Extend to end of file

## Operations on Visual Selection

### Editing
c                        # Change (delete and enter insert mode)
d                        # Delete selection
y                        # Yank (copy) selection
p                        # Paste over selection
x                        # Delete selection (same as d)
u                        # Make lowercase
U                        # Make UPPERCASE
~                        # Toggle case

### Indentation
>                        # Indent right (stays in visual mode with your config!)
<                        # Indent left (stays in visual mode with your config!)

### Other
:                        # Command mode on selection (e.g., :s/old/new/g)
o                        # Move to other end of selection
Esc                      # Exit visual mode

## Block/Column Visual Mode (Ctrl+v) - THE SECRET WEAPON

Block mode lets you select rectangular regions - perfect for column editing!

### Common Block Mode Workflows

#### Insert text at start of multiple lines
1. Ctrl+v                # Enter block mode
2. k k k                 # Select down 3 lines (or however many)
3. I                     # Insert at start of block (capital I)
4. Type your text
5. Esc Esc               # Exit (text appears on all lines!)

#### Append text at end of multiple lines
1. Ctrl+v                # Enter block mode
2. k k k                 # Select multiple lines
3. $                     # Extend to end of lines
4. A                     # Append at end of block (capital A)
5. Type your text
6. Esc Esc               # Exit

#### Delete a column of text
1. Ctrl+v                # Enter block mode
2. Select the column (use i/k/j/l)
3. d                     # Delete the block

#### Change a column
1. Ctrl+v                # Enter block mode
2. Select the column
3. c                     # Change (delete and insert)
4. Type replacement
5. Esc Esc               # Apply to all lines

## VSCode Workflows Translated to Visual Mode

### VSCode: Select word, Cmd+D multiple times, edit
**Vim way (search & replace):**
```
/word            # Search for word
:%s//newword/g   # Replace all (empty pattern reuses last search)
```
OR with confirmation:
```
/word
:%s//newword/gc  # 'c' asks for confirmation on each
```

### VSCode: Cmd+Alt+Down to add cursors, Cmd+Right, type
**Vim way (block mode):**
```
Ctrl+v           # Block mode
k k k            # Select lines
$                # Go to end
A                # Append
Type text
Esc Esc
```

### VSCode: Select lines, Cmd+Alt+Down, Alt+Right, type
**Vim way (line-wise visual + substitute):**
```
V                # Line visual
k k              # Select lines
:s/$/text/       # Append 'text' to end of each line
```
OR:
```
V k k            # Select lines
:norm A text     # Execute normal mode command on each line
```

### VSCode: Multi-cursor at end of lines
**Vim way:**
```
Ctrl+v           # Block mode
k k k            # Select lines
$                # End of all lines
A                # Append
Type
Esc Esc
```

### VSCode: Select text, Shift+Alt+Right to select words
**Vim way:**
```
v                # Visual mode
L L L            # Extend by words (your Shift+L)
```

## Advanced Visual Mode Techniques

### The "norm" Command - Run Normal Commands on Selection
```
V                # Select lines
:norm A;         # Add semicolon to end of each line
:norm I//        # Comment out each line (add // at start)
:norm llx        # Move right twice and delete on each line
```

### The Substitute Command on Selection
```
V                # Select lines
:s/old/new/g     # Replace in selection only
```

### The Global Command (Super Powerful!)
```
:g/pattern/norm A;           # Add ; to end of lines matching pattern
:g/function/norm cLnewName   # Change word after 'function' on matching lines
```

## Macros + Visual Mode = Magic

Record a macro, then replay on visual selection:

```
qa               # Start recording macro in register 'a'
... do stuff ...
q                # Stop recording
V k k            # Select lines
:norm @a         # Run macro on each line
```

## Common Workflows with Visual Mode

### Add quotes around multiple words
```
v                # Visual mode
L L L            # Select 3 words
c                # Change
"paste"          # Type with quotes
```
OR use surround plugin (if installed):
```
v L L L
S"               # Surround with quotes
```

### Comment multiple lines
```
Ctrl+v           # Block mode
k k k            # Select lines (at column 0)
I                # Insert at start
//               # Type comment
Esc Esc
```

### Indent a block of code
```
V                # Line visual
k k k            # Select lines
>                # Indent (stays in visual with your config!)
>                # Indent again if needed
```

### Delete everything inside brackets
```
vi{              # Visual select inside {}
d                # Delete
```
Also works: vi( vi[ vi" vi' vit (inside HTML tag)

### Change text inside quotes
```
ci"              # Change inside quotes (don't need visual mode!)
```

### Select entire function/block
```
V                # Line visual
a{               # Select around {} block (includes braces)
```

## Text Objects (Don't Need Visual Mode!)

These work directly without entering visual mode first:

```
ciw              # Change inner word
caw              # Change a word (includes space)
ci"              # Change inside quotes
ca"              # Change around quotes (includes quotes)
ci{              # Change inside braces
ca{              # Change around braces (includes braces)
cit              # Change inside HTML tag
```

Replace 'c' with:
- d (delete)
- y (yank/copy)
- v (visual select)

## Key Difference: Visual Mode vs Multi-Cursor

**Multi-Cursor:** Edit multiple separate locations simultaneously
- Good for: Renaming variables in different contexts
- Example: Change "user" to "customer" in 5 different places

**Visual Mode:** Select a region, apply operation once
- Good for: Operating on contiguous text, columns, or pattern-matched lines
- Example: Indent a block, delete a column, comment lines

**Visual + :norm:** Combine both - run same operation on each line
- Good for: Applying complex edits to multiple lines
- Example: Add semicolon to end of 10 lines

## Pro Tips

1. Use '.' (dot) to repeat last change - often faster than multi-cursor
2. Block mode (Ctrl+v) is underrated - master it!
3. Text objects (ciw, ci", etc.) eliminate need for precise visual selection
4. :norm command on visual selection = lightweight multi-cursor
5. Visual mode + regex substitute = very powerful

## When to Use What?

| Task | Best Approach |
|------|---------------|
| Edit multiple scattered occurrences | Multi-cursor (Ctrl+d) |
| Edit a column of text | Block visual (Ctrl+v) |
| Operate on lines matching pattern | :g/pattern/norm or :g/pattern/s// |
| Change word in same context | ci' ciw ci{ etc. (text objects) |
| Indent/comment block | Line visual (V) |
| Complex edit on multiple lines | Visual + :norm |
| Simple repeated edit | Make change, then use . to repeat |
