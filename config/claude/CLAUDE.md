# Main CLAUDE.md

## Plan and review

### Before starting to work

- Always start in plan mode
- When the plan is ready, save it to .claude/tasks/TASK_NAME.md
- Plan should be detailed implementation : detailed reasoning as well as tasks breakdown
- Never continue until the plan have been explicitly approved

## Implementation

- Keep the plan and tasks updated
- Always start by writing the tests - Unless explicitly requested not to in the plan
- If test requires mocking, write the mocks
- Never auto-accept changes

## Finishing a task

- Run the tests
- Update the .claude/roadmap/TASK_NAME.md with task implementation details and relevant documentations
- Let me handle the chores (git, merge request, ... )
