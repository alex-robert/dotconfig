# Main CLAUDE.md

## Plan and review

### Before starting to work

- Start in plan mode
- After the plan is made, update the .claude/tasks/TASK_NAME.md
- Plan should be detailed implementation : detailed reasoning as well as tasks breakdown
- DO NOT continue until I have approved the plan

## Implementation

- Keep the plan and tasks updated
- Always start by writing the tests
- If test requires mocking, write the mocks
- DO NOT continue until I have approved the tests implementations

## Finishing a task

- Run the tests
- Update the .claude/roadmap/TASK_NAME.md with task implementation details and relevant documentations
- Let me handle the chores (git, merge request, ... )
